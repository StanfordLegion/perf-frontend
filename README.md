# Legion Performance Front-End Tools

This repository contains tools for presenting Legion performance data in 
human-friendly ways (e.g. graphs, query interfaces).  Such tools are
intended to include:
  * A web dashboard with pretty charts
  * Command-line query tools and offline plot generators
  * Reactive tools that look for anomalous results and send notifications or
      request additional measurements to be performed.

The raw Legion performance data is contained in a separate
[repository](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/perf-data), although these
tools are ideally useful for other projects as well.
